+ Better formatting
    + Color "MUTED" or "NOT MUTED" red and green
    + Sort output?
        + By alphabetical or muted/not muted, maybe give user option?
            ~ Option would be in a config file so user doesn't have to reenter it.
    ~ More graph like output?

+ Realtime output
    + Act as bot
    + Connect to groupme push servers, notify in chat when someone mutes
    + If someone types !absent, reply with list of muted members

+ Token Improvements
    + Maybe mask it so it's not displayed in terminal?
    ~ Cache token to file?
        - Could be dangerous if several people use same computer
        + Maybe just look for an optional file with token in it
    ~ Is it possible for user to just log in directly without looking up dev api?
